## Invests


</div>

### Description

Invests is used to keep books on investments like municipal bonds (mainly tax free).

It may give help to learning to use events, the DataGrid control, ADO, data-bound controls, ADO record add-edit-delete, the DTPicker control for calendar work, text box, list box, multiple forms, a module to give project-wide scope to variables, log-in with encrypted password, the Keypress event to control user input, SQL,

database tables, EOF and BOF, variable scope, modality with forms, basic sorted financial transactions, form load event, automatic processing of user dollar amount, allowing inputs of just digits such as 238794 to yield $2387.94 so that decimal points need not be typed, presenting a list of days for a given month (30 for June, 31 for May)

This is not a tutorial program, but instead hopefully gives helpful examples and enough commenting that the code can be understood.

Invests.mdb database tables are used here.
 
### More Info
 
Unzip the ZippedProject file in a folder of your choosing, look over the forms and some of the code, and give it a go. The LogIn will ask for and Owner Name and a password, then the program is ready to add investment(s) post transactions, see a summary, print, etc. The program uses

App.Path so it should be portable to your folder. Your rating of the program would be appreciated, also any suggestions for improving would be appreciated in the feedback.
